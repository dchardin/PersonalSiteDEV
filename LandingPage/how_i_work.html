		<h1>About Me</h1>

	</div>	


	<div class="middle">
	
		<p><b><i>YOUR NAME: </i></b>Donald Craig Hardin Jr. (but most people call me Donnie)</p>
		<p><b><i>YOUR LOCATION: </i></b>Raleigh, North Carolina</p>
		<p><b><i>ONE WORD THAT DESCRIBES HOW YOU WORK: </i></b>Sustainably</p>
		<p><b><i>CURRENT GIG : </i></b>Support Engineer, Sensus/Xylem, Inc.</p>
		</br>
		<p><b><i>SO LETS START OFF WITH YOUR EVERYDAY TOOLS, WHAT KIND OF PHONE DO YOU USE?</i></b></p> 
		</br>
		<p>"I have been using the Oneplus One for two years now. Considering the recent dissolution of the Cyanogen company, I will probably go a different direction with my next mobile device." </p>
		</br>
		<p><b><i>HOW ABOUT YOUR COMPUTERS?</i></b></p>
		</br>
		<p>"I value the ability to be able to work anywhere and everywhere, most of my gadgets reflect this. My primary computer is a Dell XPS 13 with Xubuntu as the OS. I managed to fit a 1TB ssd, and the system comes with 8GB of RAM preinstalled. This allows me to house and run many virtual computers with various configurations."</p>
		</br>
		<p>I also have a Lenovo X230 with Fedora 26. It is a bit larger and heavier than my Dell, but it is great to have as a backup in case the XPS 13 runs into problems. </p>
		</br>
		<p><b><i>TELL US A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND AND AND HOW YOU GOT TO WHERE YOU ARE TODAY.</i></b></p>
                </br>
                <p>"As a kid, I gravitated towards building toys: Blocks, Legos, Construx, and that eventually lead me to being the little tech guy: Fixing broken VCR’s, taking apart my Power Wheels truck (nearly blinded my cousin during that experiment!)</p>
		</br>
		<p> I became exposed to computers in my gradeschool years; the first one I ever used was an Apple II, and my first home PC was a Tandy Sensation i486 from Radio Shack. During my high school years, I wasn’t very sure what I should do with my life, nor did I truly know or comprehend what my options might be.</p>
		</br>
		<p> I served in the Coast Guard reserve for a time, and then did some work to pursue a career in allied health. It did not take me long to realize that I was not at all interested in any medical profession, so after a few different odd jobs, I finally decided that I should pursue a career in technology. I got a book from the library on visual basic and wrote my first “hello world” program.</p>
		</br>
		<p>I was determined to earn a bachelors degree, so in 2008 I enrolled in a local university (UNCG) and graduated in 2012. At the time, I was not interested in programming or web development, in fact, I wasn’t really sure where I wanted to specialize, or which area of tech fascinated me the most.</p>
		</br>
		<p> I had become exposed to linux in my early days at university and fell in love. I really enjoyed using it to build websites and was amazed at the degree of freedom I had to customize my experience. I didn’t even have to pay for the right to use it!</p>
		</br>
		<p>While at university, I was pretty good at working on group projects in small teams, received good feedback. Most of them I was an individual contributor, and two I was the lead. </p>
		</br>
		<p>I scored a postgrad IT internship with Red Hat, hoping that I would be hired on for an FTE role upon completion. It was a challenging assignment. I was with the IT Finance and Facilities team, a tier II team dedicated to being Finance and Facilities representation in IT. I gained a lot of experience with Oracle’s ERP products, database administration, and large system implementation.</p> 
		</br>
		<p>Upon completion of the internship, I was disappointed to learn that there was a “hiring freeze” in place, but I was invited to remain onboard as a contractor. I decided to put in for a position with another business unit, which required passing examinations for the coveted “Red Hat Certified System Administrator, and Red Hat Certified Engineer”.</p> 
		</br>
		<p>At the time, I was able to pass the RHCSA, but not the RHCE. Speaking with some of the instructors, it seemed that my typing habits were hindering my ability to complete in time. I was embarrased to admit that I had never learned to touch type. This was one of those hard life lessons. </p>
		</br>
		<p>A colleague with the global service desk said there was an opening, and I went to work for them. Over the course of the next two years, I worked with maintaining linux systems and end user configurations. Once I felt I had built up experience, I took the RHCE exam once more and knocked it out of the park!</p>
		</br>
		<p>I shifted to remote work for the final year and found that I was made for it. However, since I was still on contract, I was having a hard time making ends meet due to high health insurance costs.</p>
		</br>
		<p>A former acquaintence introduced me to Wake Forest Baptist Health as a Senior Programmer/Analyst. I worked there for two years.</p>
		</br>
		<p>By January of 2016, I decided that I wanted to direct my career into the more technical side, I took on side projects and night courses at the local college.</p> 
		</br>
		<p>Since the position I held with WFBH was not conducive to study, I decided to resign in order to complete my refresher and run out my MGIB. I have a portfolio of projects on github, contributed to the fedora project, and explored advanced programming topics in Java, PHP, Html/css, and Python
