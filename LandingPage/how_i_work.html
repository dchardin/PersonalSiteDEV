		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p><b><i>YOUR NAME: </i></b>Donald Craig Hardin Jr. (but most people call me Donnie)</p>
		<p><b><i>YOUR LOCATION: </i></b>Raleigh, North Carolina</p>
		<p><b><i>ONE WORD THAT DESCRIBES HOW YOU WORK: </i></b>Sustainably</p>
		<p><b><i>CURRENT GIG : </i></b>Support Engineer, Sensus/Xylem, Inc.</p>
		</br>
		<p><b><i>SO LETS START OFF WITH YOUR EVERYDAY TOOLS, WHAT KIND OF PHONE DO YOU USE?</i></b></p> 
		</br>
		<p>"I have been using the Oneplus One for two years now. Considering the recent dissolution of the Cyanogen company, I will probably go a different direction with my next mobile device." </p>
		</br>
		<p><b><i>HOW ABOUT YOUR COMPUTERS?</i></b></p>
		</br>
		<p>"I value the ability to be able to work anywhere and everywhere, most of my gadgets reflect this. My primary computer is a Dell XPS 13 with Xubuntu as the OS. I managed to fit a 1TB ssd, and the system comes with 8GB of RAM preinstalled. This allows me to house and run many virtual computers with various configurations."</p>
		</br>
		<p>I also have a Lenovo X230 with Fedora 26. It is a bit larger and heavier than my Dell, but it is great to have as a backup in case the XPS 13 runs into problems. </p>
		</br>
		<p><b><i>TELL US A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND AND AND HOW YOU GOT TO WHERE YOU ARE TODAY.</i></b></p>
                </br>
                <p>"As a kid, I gravitated towards building toys: Blocks, Legos, Construx, and that eventually lead me to be</p>
		</br>
		<p> I became exposed to computers in my gradeschool years; the first one I ever used was an Apple II, and my first home PC was a Tandy Sensation i486 from Radio Shack. During my high school years, I wasn’t very sure what I should do with my life, nor did I truly know or comprehend what my options might be.</p>
		</br>
		<p> I served in the Coast Guard reserve for a time, and then did some work to pursue a career in allied health. It did not take me long to realize that I was not at all interested in any medical profession, so after a few different odd jobs, I finally decided that I should pursue a career in technology. I got a book from the library on visual basic and wrote my first “hello world” program.</p>
		</br>
		<p>I was determined to earn a bachelors degree, so in 2008 I enrolled in a local university (UNCG) and graduated in 2012. At the time, I was not interested in programming or web development, in fact, I wasn’t really sure where I wanted to specialize, or which area of tech fascinated me the most.</p>
		</br>
		<p> I had become exposed to linux in my early days at university and fell in love. I really enjoyed using it to build websites and was amazed at the degree of freedom I had to customize my experience. I didn’t even have to pay for the right to use it!</p>
		</br>
		<p>While at university, I was pretty good at working on group projects in small teams, received good feedback. Most of them I was an individual contributor, and two I was the lead. </p>
		</br>
		<p>I scored a postgrad IT internship with Red Hat, hoping that I would be hired on for an FTE role upon completion. It was a challenging assignment. I was with the IT Finance and Facilities team, a tier II team dedicated to being Finance and Facilities representation in IT. I gained a lot of experience with Oracle’s ERP products, database administration, and large system implementation.</p> 
		</br>
		<p>Upon completion of the internship, I was disappointed to learn that there was a “hiring freeze” in place, but I was invited to remain onboard as a contractor. I decided to put in for a position with another business unit, which required passing examinations for the coveted “Red Hat Certified System Administrator, and Red Hat Certified Engineer”.</p> 
		</br>
		<p>At the time, I was able to pass the RHCSA, but not the RHCE. Speaking with some of the instructors, it seemed that my typing habits were hindering my ability to complete in time. I was embarrased to admit that I had never learned to touch type. This was one of those hard life lessons. </p>
		</br>
		<p>A colleague with the global service desk said there was an opening, and I went to work for them. Over the course of the next two years, I worked with maintaining linux systems and end user configurations. Once I felt I had built up experience, I took the RHCE exam once more and knocked it out of the park!</p>
		</br>
		<p>I shifted to remote work for the final year and found that I was made for it. However, since I was still on contract, I was having a hard time making ends meet due to high health insurance costs.</p>
		</br>
		<p>A former acquaintence introduced me to Wake Forest Baptist Health as a Senior Programmer/Analyst. I worked there for two years.</p>
		</br>
		<p>By January of 2016, I decided that I wanted to direct my career into the more technical side, I took on side projects and night courses at the local college.</p> 
		</br>
		<p>Since the position I held with WFBH was not conducive to study, I decided to resign in order to complete my refresher and run out my MGIB. I have a portfolio of projects on github, contributed to the fedora project, and explored advanced programming topics in Java, PHP, Html/css, and Python
" </p>

                <p><b><i>WHAT ARE THE APPS, SOFTWARE, TOOLS, ETC. THAT YOU CANT LIVE WITHOUT?</i></b></p>
                </br>
		
		<p> Oh, my life was saved by Google Drive. I keep my daily work journal, project list, an idea journal, and all sorts of other things in there. It's very accessable and eliminates the need for carrying a physical notebook or portfolio.</p>

		</br>
		
		<p> I am a bookmarks junkie. I primariy use google chrome, and firefox to a lesser extent. Each is overflowing with bookmarks that I regularly sort and clense. So many articles, how-to's, manuals, tools etc. are hosted online.</p>

		</br>

		<p>

		I make significant use of Autokey on my linux workstation, and AutoHotKey on windows. Software engineering and administration requires far more attention to communication than most people realize. Every day, devs like myself are building and/or maintaining systems that many people depend on. With support tickets, feature requests, and other communications coming in by the boatload, I rely on my shortcuts to deliver effective responses so that I can devote more focus on my core work. Every so often, I will go through my sentbox and look for any similar sounding responses. If I find a few, I take it, abstract it, and add it to my clippings list. For example:

		</p>

		<p>

		Sorry to hear about the problem with $SERVICE. I wish I had some better news concerning it. I'll do my best to explain what's going on. Here goes:
		On $DATE, during maintenance of $SERVICE, 
		At this time, $TEAM is currently investigating the issue, but there is no current ETA on a fix.
		I truly apologize for all of this.

		</p>

		</br>

		<p> 

		It's a little bit of an art to avoid sounding like a robot.

		</p>

		</br>
                <p><b><i>WHAT IS YOUR IDEAL WORK ENVIRONMENT?</i></b></p>
                </br>

		<p> I must be allowed to wear headphones and listen to music while I work. This is not negotiable. </p>
		<p> It needs to have a healthy infrastructure for remote work. I would like the place to have a few remote workers, even if I am not one of them! I prefer to work remote, but I miss the office and my office mates sometimes. No matter what, employees in my field need to be allowed to work remotely at least one day out of the week.</p>
